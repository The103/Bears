                <p class="card-text">An example of an Asian black bear, or moon bear. They live in Asia and in the summer, inhabit elevations of around 3,500 m (11,480 ft) in the Himalayas. In winter, they go below 1,500 m (4,920 ft). They are also good climbers and spend more than half their lifetime in trees, that is until they get too large to climb around. As they spend so much time in trees, they can make a type of nest out of branches to eat and rest.</p>

                <p class="card-text">An example of a sun bear. These bears live in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. They spend the most time in trees out of all the species of bears. Unlike the moon bear, these bears don't make nests, they sleep in hollow logs or cavities in the tree. They also don't, as far as we know, hibernate. This could be because their food sourses are avalible throughout the year.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">An example of a sloth bear. These bears mostly live in India. They are known to make howls, squeals, screams, barks, and trumpet-like calls as communication. Their main distinction from other bear species is their long tongue and diet. Their diet consists of mostly bugs like ants, bees, and terrmites. To get to these bugs, the bears sniff out the nest, hive, or mound, then use their claws to get through the outer layer. Then, they use their long and tough tongues to eat all the insects in the nest.</p>

                <p class="card-text">An example of a spectacled bear. These bears live in the western side of South America. They are  good and climbing trees, and can create platforms to conceal themselfs and to store food. They also eat about 95% plants, the most of any bear species. But, they are fierce while hunting, known to pin down and eat animals while they are still alive, or to chase the animal through rough terrain and when they fall or die another way, to drag its corpse away and eat it. </p>
